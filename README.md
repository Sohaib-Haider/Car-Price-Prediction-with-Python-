ðŸš— AutoVal: Car Price Prediction with Python ðŸš—
Welcome to AutoVal, a Python-powered project designed to predict car prices with precision. By analyzing key factors like Mileage, Engine Volume (EngineV), and Year of Production, this project leverages Linear Regression to make accurate predictions and provide valuable insights into vehicle valuation.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
AutoVal aims to simplify the process of determining a car's market value by using data science techniques. Whether you're a data enthusiast or someone curious about car pricing, this project will give you a glimpse into how data can be turned into actionable insights.

ðŸ›  Features
Exploratory Data Analysis
Dive deep into the data to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.

Data Cleaning
Handle missing values and outliers to ensure the dataset is ready for accurate modeling.

Linearity Transformation
Transform the data to ensure linearity, as the initial dataset had an exponential trend.

Multicollinearity Check
Identify and address multicollinearity to avoid skewed results.

Dummy Variables Creation
Convert categorical data into numerical form to fit the Linear Regression model.

Model Building & Testing
Develop, train, and test the regression model to predict car prices accurately.
